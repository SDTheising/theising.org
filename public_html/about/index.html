              These are of course overly broad and unspecific, but I hope to put them to use within my future career. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope to find a job that can marry at least two of them, such as a position in research and data analytics using Machine Learning, 
              or a position within a game developer finding trends around player engagement and enjoyment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aside from work related interests, I still maintain an interest in biology and zoology and indulge myself frequently. 
              I am also getting back into reading after a hiatus during college.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>

          <hr>

          <p>
            I was raised in a small town in southern Indiana. Computers were not a large part of my childhood, with the exception of a Playstation 2 my father bought shortly before I was born.
            This kicked off a lifetime enjoyment of video games, which equally kicked off an interest in computers as I grew older. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite this, I wanted to be something more "Scientific." Specifically, I want to be a biologist. I dreamed of being a marine biologist in particular, 
            something about the unexplored depths drawing me in. 
          </p>

          <h2>School life.</h2>

          <hr>

          <p>
            I was never particularly good at school. I got decent grades, but I just hated to pay attention. What I loved, though, was reading. 
            And read I did, often ignoring whatever it was that my teacher was trying to tell me to instead read a new book.
          </p>

          <p>
            This reading is where I attribute my enjoyment of creating characters and worlds, which just fed into my determination to become a game designer. 
            I wanted to tell stories, and I wanted to make the things I wanted to play.
          </p>

          <p>
            My start at more technical interests is, I imagine at least, a common story for anyone my age. It all started with Minecraft, 
            where I had to learn to actually use a computer. Hacked clients were no joke, and I was not above hacking on random servers for a quick laugh.
          </p>

          <p>
            The very end of my school career was the start of COVID-19 lockdowns. During this time I decided to finally bite the bullet and learn to code before I got into college. 
            I started with C++, which may not have been the easiest choice, but I had heard that it was the most used and I wanted my skills to be useful.

          <h2>My College Career.</h2>

          <hr>

          <p>
            I went to too many colleges. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I began my college career in 2020 at Vincennes University. While there I achieved an Associate of Science in Computer Science. 
            It was a nice school, and one in which I enjoyed my time despite the smaller campus and class sizes. I learned a great deal about software development, 
            and gained my lifelong appreciation for the Java language, which is still currently my favorite despite its flaws.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that degree I transferred to IUPUI in 2022. While there I technically achieved no degree, as in 2024 the college split into IU Indy and Purdue Indy, 
            with me transferring to the Purdue side. While there I achieved my Bachelor of Arts in Applied Computer Science.
          </p>

          <h2>Post Graduate Life</h2>

          <hr>

          <p>
            This section has just started, but I've kicked it up a notch on my job search, aside from my current employment as the Web Developer at CDIS (Their new site is under construction by me) 
            and as a pharmacy technician at CVS. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've found myself able to pour much more time into my projects, but have to constantly fight paralysis from having so many choices of what to work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've taken up some extra hobbies on the side as well, such as learning photography. (Pictured above.)
