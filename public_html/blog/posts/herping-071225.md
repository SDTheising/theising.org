# Snake Fest 2025
---

In [Brown county State Park](https://www.in.gov/dnr/state-parks/parks-lakes/brown-county-state-park/), here in Indiana, they hold a yearly event called "Snake Fest."
This year I was lucky enough to go, courtesy of my brother and his enthusiasm for herpetology. 

They had several programs, each scheduled at the top of the hour from 11 am to 5 pm, though we left before the 5 pm event as it was a rerun of an earlier one for those who missed it.

The crowd was shockingly diverse, I had expected either to be surrounded by primarily elderly folks, or young children, depending on who the marketing was targeting (I had been privy to none of it, having heard of the event solely through my brother.) In spite of that assumption, there were children as young as 3 years old, adults upwards of 60, and everything in between, many coming alone, without any children in sight. 

The events were highly informative, and clearly run by people who had a lot of passion for the snakes of Indiana. The star of the show was the state-endangered Timber Rattlesnake, a particularly docile and friendly snake, despite equally being the most venomous snake in the state. 

Eli Major, the lead Interpretive Naturalist, was the host of several of the events. He was very enthusiastic about the event, and handled some of the more rowdy children well. 
He did an attempted showing of a Timber Rattlesnake feeding, but unfortunately the sweetheart was just a little shy about its diet. Instead we got to watch a Copperhead kill several mice, with absolutely no hesitation. 
I wish I had taken some photos of the presentation inside to show, but I didn't want my fairly loud shutter to interrupt the speakers, so you will have to take my word for the rest of the presentations being plenty engaging. 


The event was co-ran by the [Hoosier Herpetological Society](https://www.hoosierherpsociety.org/), a non-profit organization devoted to the study and preservation of reptiles and amphibians in the state. (Though it is unclear what their stance on birds is...) 
They brought with them several snakes, including the beautiful Mexican Burrowing Python (Which is not a python at all!)

The park itself was beautiful, I hope to go back this summer and do a little herping myself, even if I will certainly be scared the first time I hear a rattle go off beside me.
